## Process, Threads, Sockets, Ports and Methods

_Image to be added._

**Process:** is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads.

**Thread:** is a single sequence stream within a process. Threads have same properties as of the process so they are called as light weight process.

**Socket:** is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the netwo.
The socket mechanisk provies a means of inter-proces communication (IPC) by establishing named contact point between which the communiation take placr.
