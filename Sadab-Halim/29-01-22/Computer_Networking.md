## Transport Layer
- Data transferred between one computer to another is done by using Network Layer
- Transport layer is a layer which lies over devices.
- The role of the transport layer is to take the data from the network to application.

  Network Layer: Network <--> Network <br/>
  Transport Layer: Network <--> Abstraction <br/>
- Provides Abstraction
- Located on the devices
- Data Travels in Packets

- Transport Layer will attach these socket part numbers to that packets
- Transport Layer also takes control of congestion control
- Congestion control algorithms are built in TCP
