`Our Source Code` --> `Python Interpreter` --> `Running Code`

**Python Interpreter:**
- knows how to execute Python code
- translates our program into machine readable binary code

Python is a very simple language that uses a very familiar language to code.
It uses the identation to define blocks of code and they need to be consistent throughtout the block.

Python is a case-sensitive language.

**Syntax of Python File:** `.py`

## Python Keywords
Keywords are the reserved words in Python.

We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

There are 33 keywords in Python <br/>

`False` `await` `else` `import` `pass` <br/>
`None` `break` `except` `in` `raise` <br/>
`True` `class` `finally` `is` `return` <br/>
`and` `continue` `for` `lambda` `try` <br/>
`as` `def` `from` `nonlocal` `while` <br/>
`assert` `del` `global` `not` `with` <br/>
`async` `elif` `if` `or` `yield` <br/>

## Python Variables

Declaring and assigning value to a variable
```
website = "google.com"
print(website)
```

**NOTE:** Python is a type-inferrred language, so we don't have to expicitly define the variable type.

Changing the value of a variable
```
website = "google.com"
print(website)

website = "youtube.com"
print(website)
```
