### Topologies

- **Bus Topology:** <br/>
  a. They are connected through a single cable known as backbone cable.<br/>
  b. If one part gets broken entire system will fail. <br/>
  c. Only 1 person at a time can send information. <br/>
  d. 
  
- **Ring Topology:** <br/>
  a. Every system communicates with one another. <br/>
  b. If one of the cables break we won't be able to send data. <br/>
  c. A lot of unnecessary calls are made. <br/>
  
- **Star Topology:** <br/>
  a. There will be one central device that will be connected to all computers
  b. If central device, then the system will go down.
- Tree Topology
- Mesh Topology
